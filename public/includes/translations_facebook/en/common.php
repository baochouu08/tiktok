    'faq_video_quality' => 'Can I download Facebook videos in 4K?',
    'faq_video_quality_ans' => 'Yes, you can. Our tool is designed to fetch the highest possible quality available on Facebook\'s servers. If the original video was uploaded in 4K, you will see a 4K download option. We support all resolutions, from standard definition (SD) to high definition (720p, 1080p) and Ultra HD (2K, 4K).

It\'s the perfect solution for saving exclusive content.',

    'faq_need_account' => 'Do I need to log in to my Facebook account?',
    'faq_need_account_ans' => 'No, a login is not required for downloading any public videos, Reels, or Stories. Our service is anonymous.

    'faq_is_safe' => 'Is it safe to use this Facebook video downloader?',
    'faq_is_safe_ans' => 'Your safety is our top priority. Our tool is 100% secure.

    'faq_storage_duration' => 'Where are my downloaded videos saved on my device?',
    'faq_storage_duration_ans' => 'Your files are saved directly to your device\'s default download location. On a mobile phone (iPhone or Android), this is typically your main photo library or "Gallery" app, making it easy to find.
